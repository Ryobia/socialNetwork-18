# socialNetwork-  week 18 ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description 
  So this is just like a proof of concept kind of thing with MongoDB and Mongoose on express. It was very stressful and all it does is allows you to make a user, post thoughts or reactions to those thoughts as a user and you can also add friends. It works exactly as intended which is as much as anyone can ask for I suppose. I have a video showing that it works through insomnia and it's super stressful and I really hate making those videos cause you can't afford to mess up because you have to do it under 5 minutes and when we have to show 14 different routes in one video it's tough but I did it and now I'm never looking at this again.
